//! # laya
//!
//! Pure-Rust port of the [Laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) non-autoregressive
//! System-1 decision engine (the **Laya-Decision** project).
//!
//! Given a *state* (text, JSON, or a conversation list) and a set of *typed questions*
//! (`choice`, `score`, `noul`), Laya scores every question in a single forward pass — no
//! text generation. Inference runs natively on [candle]; the routing, language-detection,
//! email-cleaning, preset and shortlist logic is dependency-free.
//!
//! The pure-logic modules build without the `model` feature; enabling it (on by default)
//! pulls in candle + the Hugging Face tokenizer and Hub download.
